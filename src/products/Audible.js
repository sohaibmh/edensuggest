      <h3> Audible</h3>
      There’s only one word for this: love! Audible is an extremely good product
      that allows me to listen to my favourite books. I am a slow reader and get
      bored quickly when I read a book. And when reading a book I have to
      dedicate all my attention into reading that book – i.e. I’m not able to
      multitask. But when it comes to listening a book, I’m able to adjust the
      listening speed, I can listen to the book when I’m working out, or when
      I’m driving etc etc! I love it and I would recommend it to every single
      person! The great thing is that you can get a free 30 day trial.
