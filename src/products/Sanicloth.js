          So I used to work in a hospital lab where we had this product
          available for us to clean our desks, pipettes, vortex, and any other
          equipment, you name it. But when I would go home I would yearn for
          this as I was so used to it at work. So I searched it on Amazon, and
          to my delight, it was available and I immediately bought it. Itâ€™s
          really good and I would use it to disinfect anything!
