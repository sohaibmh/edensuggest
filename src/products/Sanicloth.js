      <h3>Sanicloth UNXPOO159 70 Alcohol Wipes</h3>So I used to work in a
      hospital lab where we had this product available for us to clean our
      desks, pipettes, vortex, and any other equipment, you name it. But when I
      would go home I would yearn for this as I was so used to it at work. So I
      searched it on Amazon, and to my delight, it was available and I
      immediately bought it. Itâ€™s really good and I would use it to disinfect
      anything!
